 I followed along with Mackenzie as he showed me how to build a Jobs Board application. In this app, we have the ability to Add, Edit, Destroy jobs postings and each job post is assigned to a category, and we are able to filter between the various categories to see only jobs within that category (For example, only “Full-Time” jobs).
